# compose-vs-inherit

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

See each of three branches (or look at the diff in the PR!)

- inheritance
- cascade

This isn't intended to be super thorough; I threw it together to get a (very rough) set of examples to show how one might solve the same problem via composition or inheritance. In this case, some CRUD on a database. There isn't a database in here, just a simple in-memory object/array. Yes, it could be much better, but I wasn't trying to solve that problem here :)
